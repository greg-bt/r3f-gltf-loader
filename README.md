## r3f-gltf-loader

Example of gltf loading and WebXR with `react-three-fiber`. 

WebXR only works over HTTPS so experimental https has to be enable on the development server:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --experimental-https"
  }
}
```

The environment HDRI was taken from [Polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/kloofendal_48d_partly_cloudy_puresky).
